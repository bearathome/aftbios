# RNA Logic Gates for Smart, Sprayable Crops

We are excited to announce our latest innovation in synthetic biology â€” the development of RNA-based logic gates for agricultural applications.

![AND Logic Gate](/news-images/logic-gate-and.png)
*AND gate: activates when both inputs are present.*

![OR Logic Gate](/news-images/logic-gate-or.png)
*OR gate: activates when either input is present.*

These RNA logic circuits offer modular, tunable, and intelligent responses for field-deployable crops.
