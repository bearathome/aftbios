# RNA Logic Gates for Smart, Sprayable Crops

*24 April 2024*

## Overview
We present a new class of **RNA-based logic circuits** that enable crops to make intelligent, on-site decisions in response to drought, pests, or a combination of stresses. These programmable gates deliver targeted protection while minimising energy costs to the plant.

## 1 What Are RNA Logic Gates?
In electronics, logic gates decide whether current flows; in biology, **RNA logic gates** decide whether genes are expressed. By wiring together stress-responsive RNAs, we can trigger or silence downstream pathways with digital precision—**all without editing the plant genome**.

## 2 Two Gate Architectures

### 2.1 AND Gate — Dual-Stress Precision  
A defensive response is launched **only when _both_ drought _and_ pest signals are present**.

**Why it matters**  
Plants conserve resources under mild, single-stress events, activating costly defences only under genuine combined pressure.
**Energy-efficient defenses**: Activation only under real combined stresses (AND gate).
**Faster protection**: Rapid action under any single threat (OR gate).
**Non-GMO potential**: These RNA systems could be deployed via external application (e.g., sprays) without genome modification.
**Climate-smart agriculture**: Tailoring plant behavior to real field conditions improves resilience and sustainability.

### 2.2 OR Gate — Rapid Single-Stress Response  
A protective response is launched when **either drought _or_ pest signal is detected**.

*Figure 2 OR gate activates when at least one input RNA is present.*

**Why it matters**  
Provides immediate protection when any individual threat appears—ideal for regions with erratic weather or sudden pest outbreaks.

## 3 Mechanism of Action — Step-by-Step

| Step | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Drought increases abscisic acid (ABA); pest feeding raises jasmonic acid (JA). |
| 2 | ABA-inducible **_RD29A_** promoter transcribes **Input RNA A**; JA-inducible **_VSP1_** promoter transcribes **Input RNA B**. |
| 3 | Gate logic evaluates the presence of A and B. |
| 4 | Upon activation, the gate removes an RNA transcriptional road-block. |
| 5 | The plant transcribes a full-length **hpRNA** targeting a critical pest gene. |
| 6 | Dicer processes hpRNA into siRNAs → RNA interference disables pest feeding. |

## 4 Field Advantages

* **Energy Efficiency** — AND gates avoid unnecessary defence costs.  
* **Speed** — OR gates deliver fast response to single threats.  
* **Non-GMO Compliance** — Circuits can be topical (sprayable) RNA formulations.  
* **Climate Resilience** — Programmable logic adapts to real-world stress patterns.

## 5 Next Steps

1. **Greenhouse validation** in cowpea (*Vigna unguiculata*).  
2. **Topical RNA formulation** trials for foliar application.  
3. Scale-up manufacturing of synthetic RNAs for field deployment.
