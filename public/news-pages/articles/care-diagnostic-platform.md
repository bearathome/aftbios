AFTBios is excited to unveil the prototype stage of our innovative Point of Care Diagnostic platform. This pioneering project marks a significant milestone in disease detection and management. By integrating cutting-edge isothermal amplification of nucleic acids with advanced miniaturisation techniques, our platform is set to redefine rapid, accurate, and accessible diagnostic solutions within the healthcare sector.
\
Currently in its initial development phase, this prototype represents the first step towards revolutionising point-of-care diagnostics. Our dedicated team of researchers and engineers is focused on refining this technology to ensure it meets the high standards required for real-world application. This early-stage prototype is the foundation upon which we will build a comprehensive diagnostic tool, capable of addressing the urgent need for quick and reliable diagnostics across various healthcare settings.
